With its cards, customers can enjoy spicy rewards, cashbacks, and pay with crypto in a secure, confidential and low-cost manner.\nLaunched in Q1, 2024, the Xuirin project exploded in the cryptocurrency market with its DeFi cards offering.\nIn general, Xuirin represents a new-gen attempt to solve issues with credit card usage in DeFi and introduce a sphere of cryptocurrencies to newcomers.\nIn the segment of cryptocurrencies, credit cards have been used frequently since the mid-2010s. Typically, these cards can be topped up with cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (BTC), U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) or major altcoins with the largest liquidity. Once funded with crypto, this card works not unlike regular ones issued by classic banks on top of Visa and Mastercard payments processors.\nIn general, crypto cards are developed and promoted by large centralized exchanges: Binance, Coinbase, Bybit have their own card programs. The usage of crypto cards might be restricted in some jurisdictions with no clear legal framework for issuance and usage of Web3 products.\nThe adoption of credit cards associated with cryptocurrency payment operators is catalyzed by the flexibility, resource-efficiency and profitability of these solutions for the end customers.\nAs such, more and more cryptocurrency users are considering trying DeFi cards for personal and business needs.\nThe novel crypto debit card project Xuirin employs all the latest developments in DeFi to offer the most convenient and resource-efficient card for daily usage in personal and commercial use cases.\nIntroduced by a team of cryptocurrency developers and entrepreneurs in 2024, Xuirin is an ecosystem of crypto debit cards. As per statements of its representatives shared on the official Xuirin website, the ecosystem includes DeFi debit cards themselves, intelligent crypto payment gateways, an AI-powered peer-to-peer (P2P) lending module and a multi-chain, non-custodial, highly secure decentralized cryptocurrency wallet.\nDespite being in very early phases of development, the project has already scored a third-party security audit with SolidProof, a reputable cybersec team in crypto and blockchain.\nThe project’s economics are underpinned by the native eponymous token XUIRIN, which is issued on top of Ethereum (ETH) as an ERC-20 asset.

Meanwhile, KangaMoon is currently priced at $0.025 in the bonus stage of its presale and experts anticipate further gains in its price. With the constant influx of funds in the meme coin space, evident by the current $9 billion trading volume within the last 24 hours, crypto enthusiasts think that both KANG and FLOKI could be ready for a 50% price hike.\nNot just any meme coin, FLOKI is a cryptocurrency with sound fundamentals that is poised to lead the field during the current bull run. With its current progress, FLOKI claims to be the second-largest gaming project on CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Valhalla, the premier metaverse game, is almost ready to launch on the mainnet.\nBased on the examination of past years’ FLOKI price, it is projected that FLOKI’s minimum price in 2025 will be approximately $0.000347. The highest FLOKI price that might be anticipated is possibly $0.000414. In 2025, the average trading price might be $0.000357.\nThe rising KANG, which is drawing the interest of other cryptocurrency holders, may be spent as money in the future play-to-earn (P2E) game KangaMoon, in contrast to most memecoins, which only exist as digital assets. The newest gaming craze provides users with a wide range of options, such as betting on results, watching battles unfold, and engaging in player-versus-player combat.\nThis results in an engaging, dynamic, and socially infused gaming experience. Additionally, KangaMoon holders receive exclusive advantages such as the opportunity to participate in weekly, monthly, or three-month assignments that award extra tokens and in-game goodies. Because they can be purchased and sold on the KangaMoon marketplace, these items have actual value.\n🌟 Upcoming New Listing 🌟\n🤩 #BitMart will list #KANG @Kangamoon_P2E soon!\nKeep an eye on our socials for further announcements.\nShare in the comments what you like about this project👇 pic.twitter.com/YvT39QoKba\n— BitMart (@BitMartExchange) May 15, 2024\nThis enables users to profit from the assets in their games. At its current price of $0.025, KangaMoon has increased its value by 400% since its initial release. Right now, it’s in the presale bonus stage. However, when it is offered by a Tier-1 controlled exchange (CEX) in the second quarter of 2024, the value of the meme coin is anticipated to increase even further. Analysts forecast a potential 100X increase.\nKangaMoon has a low market capitalization, thus it needs less new money to increase its price. Because of this advantage, KANG could be among the best meme coins to buy and perhaps be able to outperform FLOKI.\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

This was most certainly seen as a stepping-stone in bringing the crypto and traditional financial markets together � offering a regulated pathway for investment in digital assets.\nBut still not many investors from both Web3 and traditional investment backgrounds seem to fully understand the key differences between investing in bitcoin versus investing in bitcoin ETFs.\nWhen you purchase bitcoin you gain full ownership and control over your assets (lest we forget with unlimited trading hours and potentially lower fees). But there are some downsides to be aware of. First, you need technical blockchain wallet know-how and an understanding of cryptoeconomics. Secondly, and more importantly, you can�t include your bitcoin investment in traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s.\nInvesting in bitcoin ETFs can also be advantageous for a few reasons: Ease of access, simplified investment, regulatory and security benefits, market integration, liquidity, diversification and potential tax benefits. The main downside is that you don�t really personally possess actual bitcoin. Add to this high management fees, operational costs, market hours limitation and potential tracking errors.\nBut what if there was a third option? One that combines the positives of both � direct bitcoin ownership and bitcoin ETFs � while also addressing their respective negatives? If you live in the United States, chances are that you have already heard of an IRA (short for �Individual Retirement Account�), a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account designed for individuals with earned income to save for retirement.\nIn recent years, IRAs have gone on to cover a broad spectrum � including cryptocurrencies, known as Crypto IRAs � a self-directed Individual Retirement Account (SDIRA) which allows investors to include digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum and others in their retirement portfolios. And as more investors are flocking to Crypto IRAs in the middle of this ongoing bull run, it’s quite evident that the future of retirement planning is becoming increasingly intertwined with the world of digital assets.\nInvesting in a Crypto IRA can offer several benefits and advantages: Tax-advantaged growth (either tax-deferred or tax-free), digital asset security and diversification. By incorporating cryptocurrencies into retirement savings, investors are bullish on adding this decentralized asset class to their portfolios � potentially maximizing the compounding effect of investments while minimizing immediate tax liabilities.\nLet’s consider a simple example to illustrate the tax benefits. Say you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin and it increases to $65,000. That’s a $40,000 gain. While this sounds great, the issue is that these profits are now subject to capital gains tax. In comparison, if you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin in a Roth IRA (with tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and its value increases to $65,000 you’ve still made a $40,000 gain.\nAnd the best part is that when you sell in the future, you’re not subject to capital gains tax and you can keep all of your profits.\nBut for crypto IRAs to pave the way for the future of retirement investing, we need a trustworthy, reliable and user-friendly approach. We need a solution that not only simplifies the process of buying and selling crypto through tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but also keeps costs low, stays transparent and makes investing in crypto assets with IRAs a walk in the park.\nOne such platform is iTrustCapital, led by CEO Kevin Maloney, a former compliance officer at the $2.5 trillion asset management firm PIMCO, and best known for working closely with regulatory agencies like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe platform has seen a surge in activity recently, with both an influx of new accounts being funded and a large number of holding accounts coming back to life, no doubt after reigniting their interest in the crypto space. Clients who were inactive during the bear market are now returning in droves � not just to check their accounts but to start transacting again.\nClients enjoy the flexibility of being able to buy and sell digital assets 24/7 � unlike ETFs which are only available for trading during market hours. This round-the-clock access allows investors to make decisions based on real-time market movements and their own investment strategies.\niTrustCapital offers a wide range of digital assets for investors to choose from � including popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and a variety of altcoins. Such an approach allows investors to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space � potentially mitigating risk and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.\nAnother significant advantage is the ability to buy and sell within the account without creating a taxable event. Clients can buy and sell different digital assets and only incur a small fee, similar to other exchanges. This feature is particularly valuable for investors looking to rebalance their portfolios or take advantage of market fluctuations without worrying about immediate tax implications.\niTrustCapital also offers the option to move assets from other crypto IRAs into its platform. This flexibility allows investors who may be dissatisfied with the limited offerings or high fees from their current provider, to consolidate their crypto holdings under one roof. Thus, investors can enjoy an extensive range of digital assets and a competitive fee structure with iTrustCapital.\niTrustCapital has leveraged the regulated infrastructure of experienced third party compliance and custodial services in Web3. The company has done so by evaluating potential partners based on its deep domain knowledge, clean charters, excellent technology platforms and outstanding experience teams committed to doing the right thing. Ultimately, the company uses a regulated, state-chartered trust company to hold the self-directed IRAs and custody client assets.\nThe goal is to prioritize customer trust and safety around the purchase and safeguarding of their digital assets. In order to ensure reliability and peace of mind, iTrustCapital never takes custody of its clients’ assets, nor does it leverage those assets for profit.\nMoreover, iTrustCapital holds clients’ assets \"off-balance sheet,\" meaning that client assets are never actually recorded on the company’s financial statements. By not including those assets, the company’s business activities, its financial ratios and its overall leverage strategy remain unaffected by the amount of assets held for their clients. This approach demonstrates iTrustCapital’s commitment to being fully transparent with its customer base and to continuously follow ethical practices.\nIncluding iTrustCapital in your IRA strategy means knowing that your assets are safe and secure with a company that puts the highest value on customer trust.\nLooking ahead, it’s plausible that Crypto IRAs will become an increasingly common component of retirement portfolios. More investors are recognizing the potential benefits of including digital assets in their retirement portfolios � whether for diversification, long-term growth or as a hedge against traditional market volatility.\nAs younger generations who are more comfortable with digital assets begin to plan for their financial futures, platforms like iTrustCapital, through its wide range of digital assets and the security of a regulated custodian, will be well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand for Crypto IRAs.\nIf you are looking for more information on how to start your crypto IRA with iTrustCapital, visit the website: https://www.itrustcapital.com/. iTrustCapital does not provide legal, investment or tax advice.

This breakthrough technology utilizes a blend of electroencephalography (EEG), brain-computer interfaces, and large language models to decode brain activity, representing a significant leap forward in brain-to-text communication. This breakthrough is reflective of the advances documented in the research paper \"BRAIN DECODING: TOWARD REAL-TIME RECONSTRUCTION OF VISUAL PERCEPTION\" by Yohann Benchetrit, Hubert Banville, and Jean-Remi King.\nDeWave simplifies the process of translating thoughts to text, distinguishing itself from other technologies in this space. Users need only to wear an EEG headset and activate their thoughts to enable the translation. This method is notably less invasive compared to other technologies, such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which requires surgical implantation of a brain-machine interface chip. DeWave’s approach offers a more accessible and non-invasive solution, making it a potentially revolutionary tool for those with speech impairments due to conditions like stroke, brain thrombosis, or deafness. Currently, DeWave achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 40% in its translations.\nThis technology’s significance was recognized globally when it was selected as an important paper by the NeurIPS conference, one of the most prestigious gatherings in the machine learning community. DeWave’s approach is somewhat similar to a project by Meta, which used MEG (magnetoencephalography) to reconstruct human brain imaging processes. Both initiatives share the common goal of capturing and decoding faint brain activity through EEG and MEG tools. After acquiring the raw brain data, researchers employ large language models to decode it, extracting crucial visual and textual information. This process is fundamental in translating and reconstructing human thoughts and mental images.\nThe core technology of DeWave involves transforming continuous brainwave signals into discrete codes. This is achieved using a structure known as a vector quantized variational encoder, which converts received brainwave signals into a series of vectorized feature representations. These representations are then turned into a series of discrete codes, each corresponding to a discrete word vector in a codebook. The codebook functions like a dictionary, containing a limited number of discrete word vectors. The most matching discrete word vector from the codebook is used to obtain the corresponding discrete code. Once a series of discrete codes is obtained, they can be processed like language word vectors and inputted into a pre-trained large language model to generate the translated text content.\nDespite its innovative approach and potential applications, DeWave is not without its challenges. The model’s reliance on pre-trained language models like BART limits its performance to the quality and capabilities of these models. If the pre-trained language model lacks accuracy or a broad understanding of language, it could affect the translation performance of the DeWave method. Additionally, the DeWave method’s training process requires the use of parallel brainwave and text pair data for supervised learning. The acquisition of large-scale parallel data can be difficult or costly for certain tasks, which might limit the performance of the DeWave method. Another limitation is the model’s dependence on labeled data. Despite claims of being able to translate brainwaves to text without labels, such as eye-tracking, DeWave still relies on a label-based alignment process. It uses event markers to segment brainwaves into word-level features, which could lead to inaccuracies in translation and segmentation in the absence of labels.\nIn conclusion, DeWave represents a significant step forward in the field of AI and neuroscience. By enabling the translation of human thoughts into text, it opens up new possibilities for communication, especially for those with speech impairments. However, like any pioneering technology, it faces challenges and limitations that will need to be addressed in future developments. As research and technology continue to advance, DeWave has the potential to become an even more effective tool for bridging the gap between human thought and communication.\n","create_date":"2024-01-05","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"},{"url":"https://bitcoinist.com/how-to-earn-bitcoin-the-definitive-passive-btc-and-crypto-income-guide/","web_url":"https://bitcoinist.com/","type":"article","description":"It is clearly evident that Bitcoin has garnered much prominence as an investable asset. This can be seen from the various BTC- institutional-grade offerings","title":"How To Earn Bitcoin: The Definitive Passive BTC Income Guide","content":"Have you ever wondered how you can earn bitcoin passively in the modern crypto age? Well look no further, here is the perfect guide to help you get started.\nBitcoin has generated massive returns since it began publicly trading in 2010. BTC has had its bearish periods but the overall trend has remained very bullish. The graph below shows the market cap of Bitcoin from 2014 to date.\nIt is clearly evident that Bitcoin has garnered much prominence as an investable asset. This can be seen from the various BTC- institutional-grade offerings designed by key industry players like Bakkt and Fidelity, to involve Wall Street market participants.\nBTC has gone through quite some market cycles to achieve the market valuation it currently possesses. Hence, it may not be financially viable for a lot of traders to buy large amounts of Bitcoin. Even buying fractions of BTC would require shelling out of generous amounts of cash.\nIn light of this, here is a list of alternative ways to generate passive income through earning free BTC just before the 3rd Bitcoin Halving in May 2020.\nThe master list\nWorking in exchange for BTC is the easiest and most legitimate way of earning bitcoin.\nWhether you are a developer, designer, writer, translator, editor, internet marketer, freelancer or engineer, you can start working for Bitcoin right now.\nThere are numerous platforms and websites that offer you bitcoin in exchange for your service.\nSome of these platforms include:\nEach bitcoin (BTC) is divisible up to8 decimal places, so each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 units. Each unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 BTC, is called a satoshi. A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin.\nOne of the ways to earn bitcoin is to accumulate large amounts of Satoshis through trading altcoins/ all cryptocurrencies except BTC, and then convert them to bitcoin.\nEvery trading pair is formed as ALTxBTC, not ALTxUSD\nWhen you’re buying and selling an altcoin in sats (Satoshis), if you sell when it’s up in USD but not sats, you end up inadvertently trading away your bitcoin. You must learn to trade relative to bitcoin, as accumulating satoshis is the only way to win this game. The key is to value bitcoin individually and not relative to USD.\nStart: 100k sats is worth $5. Altcoin is worth 100k sats. You buy 1 altcoin at 100k sats.\nScenario 1: 100k sats are now worth $4. Altcoin is now worth 100k sats.\nScenario 2: 100k sats is now worth $6. Altcoin is now worth 100k sats.\nScenario 3: 100k sats is now worth $5. Altcoin is now worth 120k sats.\nWith #1, Altcoin is down 20% in USD but you’ve stayed the same in satoshi value. Which means you have the same value as Bitcoin. Which is good!\nWith #2, you’re up 20% in USD but not Satoshi. Which means you have the same value as Bitcoin. Which is again good!\nWith #3, you’re up 20% in satoshi, but the same in USD. Which is better!\nSince the value of BTC is higher than USD, always trade in Bitcoin or Satoshi and you reap more profits.\nThis example highlights the issues in valuing crypto assets in USD. #3, you’d realize your Satoshi gains by converting to BTC. #1and #2 there are no conversions to be made as your sats are the same, but #2, people trading USD value may make a trade, and see a gain in USD but with Bitcoin value, they have neither booked a profit nor a loss. To people trading, USD value for #2 and #3 are actually the same, even though the alt is going from $5 to $6 in USD.\nThe difference is that in #3 the alt is outpacing BTC growth, which is the outcome we are looking for while in #2 it’s just pacing the same as BTC. #2 is not a trade to be made.#3 is the only trade to be made.\nEbates, a popular Google Chrome Extension, offers customers cash-back for their purchases from thousands of websites. They work with almost all major online retailers, including everything from Best Buy to Groupon, to Nike. Once you install the extension and create an account, Ebates will notify you if there are discounts available while you browse a retailer’s website. In one click you can activate the discounts. At the end of every quarter, you get a check from Ebates with your cashback balance. It’s that simple.\nIn crypto, a company called Lolli is offering similar services. Make purchases on websites like Sephora, Macy’s, CVS or any of the 500+ partner stores, and get cash-back in Bitcoin. Every store has a different incentive amount. Some offer as much as 9% cash-back. Others will offer a set amount of BTC. This is a very easy way to earn free Bitcoin while making your everyday purchases.\nOther similar apps are:\nCertain companies will pay you (in Bitcoin or fiat) if you invite paying customers on to their platforms. This marketing method, called “affiliate marketing,” has been around for a long time and allows users to establish an additional income stream.\nThere are different structures provided by firms for their affiliate programs. With a lot of e-commerce brands, you can earn a percentage on your referred customer’s total order amount. For others, you may get a set fee for every person who signs up for a service using your promo code.\nFew referral programs offered by well-established Bitcoin and crypto trading businesses are worth looking into this regard.\nBinance boasts of harboring the globe’s most actively traded exchanges. It is one of the industry’s most trusted crypto trading platforms and regularly updates its services to give customers new trading opportunities. According to the Binance referral page, some of the top referrals have made commissions of 115 – 186 BTC.\nHow does the Binance Affiliate Program work?\nStep 1: Sign up for a Binance Affiliate\nSubmit your application by filling a form. Their team evaluates your application and decides whether to approve it or not based on certain criteria.\nStep 2: Create and Share your referral links\nCreate and manage your referral links from your Binance Account. You can track the performance for each referral link you share. These can be customized for each channel and for various discounts you would like to share with your community.\nStep 3: Sit back, relax and earn commissions\nWhen someone signs up or registers an account on Binance with your referral link, you can get up to 50% commission every time they complete a trade.\nSan-Francisco based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is one of the oldest and most well-known crypto trading platforms. Coinbase will pay you $10 for every customer who signs up and deposits at least $100. You also receive 50% of your referees’ trading fees for the first 3 months\nStep 1: Become an affiliate\nAfter you signed up and your application is approved, you’ll get access to promotional assets and Coinbase’s tracking software.\nStep 2: Promote Coinbase\nLink to Coinbase in articles, create new content or place ads on your website.\nStep 3: Earn commissions\nWhen new customers join Coinbase through your promotions, you earn a commission.\nChangelly is one more known crypto exchange that provides a great affiliate program.

This breakthrough technology utilizes a blend of electroencephalography (EEG), brain-computer interfaces, and large language models to decode brain activity, representing a significant leap forward in brain-to-text communication. This breakthrough is reflective of the advances documented in the research paper \"BRAIN DECODING: TOWARD REAL-TIME RECONSTRUCTION OF VISUAL PERCEPTION\" by Yohann Benchetrit, Hubert Banville, and Jean-Remi King.\nDeWave simplifies the process of translating thoughts to text, distinguishing itself from other technologies in this space. Users need only to wear an EEG headset and activate their thoughts to enable the translation. This method is notably less invasive compared to other technologies, such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which requires surgical implantation of a brain-machine interface chip. DeWave’s approach offers a more accessible and non-invasive solution, making it a potentially revolutionary tool for those with speech impairments due to conditions like stroke, brain thrombosis, or deafness. Currently, DeWave achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 40% in its translations.\nThis technology’s significance was recognized globally when it was selected as an important paper by the NeurIPS conference, one of the most prestigious gatherings in the machine learning community. DeWave’s approach is somewhat similar to a project by Meta, which used MEG (magnetoencephalography) to reconstruct human brain imaging processes. Both initiatives share the common goal of capturing and decoding faint brain activity through EEG and MEG tools. After acquiring the raw brain data, researchers employ large language models to decode it, extracting crucial visual and textual information. This process is fundamental in translating and reconstructing human thoughts and mental images.\nThe core technology of DeWave involves transforming continuous brainwave signals into discrete codes. This is achieved using a structure known as a vector quantized variational encoder, which converts received brainwave signals into a series of vectorized feature representations. These representations are then turned into a series of discrete codes, each corresponding to a discrete word vector in a codebook. The codebook functions like a dictionary, containing a limited number of discrete word vectors. The most matching discrete word vector from the codebook is used to obtain the corresponding discrete code. Once a series of discrete codes is obtained, they can be processed like language word vectors and inputted into a pre-trained large language model to generate the translated text content.\nDespite its innovative approach and potential applications, DeWave is not without its challenges. The model’s reliance on pre-trained language models like BART limits its performance to the quality and capabilities of these models. If the pre-trained language model lacks accuracy or a broad understanding of language, it could affect the translation performance of the DeWave method. Additionally, the DeWave method’s training process requires the use of parallel brainwave and text pair data for supervised learning. The acquisition of large-scale parallel data can be difficult or costly for certain tasks, which might limit the performance of the DeWave method. Another limitation is the model’s dependence on labeled data. Despite claims of being able to translate brainwaves to text without labels, such as eye-tracking, DeWave still relies on a label-based alignment process. It uses event markers to segment brainwaves into word-level features, which could lead to inaccuracies in translation and segmentation in the absence of labels.\nIn conclusion, DeWave represents a significant step forward in the field of AI and neuroscience. By enabling the translation of human thoughts into text, it opens up new possibilities for communication, especially for those with speech impairments. However, like any pioneering technology, it faces challenges and limitations that will need to be addressed in future developments. As research and technology continue to advance, DeWave has the potential to become an even more effective tool for bridging the gap between human thought and communication.\n","create_date":"2024-01-05","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"},{"url":"https://bitcoinist.com/is-kangamoon-and-floki-ready-for-a-50-price-hike/","web_url":"https://bitcoinist.com/","type":"article","description":"Recent FLOKI price prediction reveals that the token has the potential to reach $0.000414 in 2025.

LeCun began the DjVu project in the mid-1990s at ATandT Labs, aiming to create an efficient method for distributing high-resolution scanned documents over the Internet. The DjVu format, later released in the late 90s/early 00s, found adoption by platforms such as the Internet Archive.\nLeCun’s initiative to scan and distribute the complete collection of Neural Information Processing (NIPS) conference proceedings further exemplified the format’s usefulness. Gaining permission from publishers Morgan Kaufman and MIT Press, who were not earning revenue from past proceedings, LeCun and his team successfully made these resources widely accessible by 2000 through a free website.\nThis move was pivotal in shaping the culture of the ML/AI community towards open-access and rapid sharing of preprint publications. Around the same time, the community’s pushback against commercial journal publishers led to the creation of the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), an open-access and free journal, further endorsing this trend.\nLeCun also recounted an intriguing episode with Springer, the for-profit publisher that owned rights to the first volume of NIPS. Initially refusing permission for digital dissemination, a surge of email requests directed at a Springer executive led to rapid reversal of this decision, highlighting the community’s collective influence.\nOther contributors to the DjVu project, such as L’on Bottou and Patrick Haffner, were acknowledged by LeCun for their significant roles. The format’s legacy extends beyond academic circles, influencing projects like Google’s book scanning initiative and the Internet Archive’s Million Books project.\nLeCun’s reflections shed light on the evolving dynamics of intellectual property in the digital age, emphasizing the importance of open-access resources in democratizing knowledge and fostering innovation in fields like machine learning and AI.\n","create_date":"2024-01-06","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"},{"url":"https://blockchain.news/analysis/streamingllm-breakthrough-handling-over-4-million-tokens-with-222x-inference-speedup","web_url":"https://blockchain.news","type":"article","description":"SwiftInfer, leveraging StreamingLLM’s groundbreaking technology, significantly enhances large language model inference, enabling efficient handling of over 4 million tokens in multi-round conversat","title":"StreamingLLM Breakthrough: Handling Over 4 Million Tokens with 22.2x Inference Speedup","content":"In the dynamic field of AI and large language models (LLMs), recent advancements have brought significant improvements in handling multi-round conversations. The challenge with LLMs like ChatGPT is maintaining generation quality during extended interactions, constrained by the input length and GPU memory limits. LLMs struggle with inputs longer than their training sequence and can collapse if the input exceeds the attention window, limited by GPU memory\nThe introduction of StreamingLLM by Xiao et al. published with title \"EFFICIENT STREAMING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH ATTENTION SINKS\" from MIT has been a breakthrough. This method allows streaming text inputs of over 4 million tokens in multi-round conversations without compromising on inference speed and generation quality, achieving a remarkable 22.2 times speedup compared to traditional methods. However, StreamingLLM, implemented in native PyTorch, needed further optimization for practical applications requiring low cost, low latency, and high throughput.\nAddressing this need, the Colossal-AI team developed SwiftInfer, a TensorRT-based implementation of StreamingLLM. This implementation enhances the inference performance of large language models by an additional 46%, making it an efficient solution for multi-round conversations.\nSwiftInfer’s combination with TensorRT inference optimization in the SwiftInfer project maintains all advantages of the original StreamingLLM while boosting inference efficiency. Using TensorRT-LLM’s API, models can be constructed similarly to PyTorch models. It’s crucial to note that StreamingLLM doesn’t increase the context length the model can access but ensures model generation with longer dialog text inputs.\nColossal-AI, a PyTorch-based AI system, has also been integral in this progress. It uses multi-dimensional parallelism, heterogeneous memory management, among other techniques, to reduce AI model training, fine-tuning, and inference costs. It has gained over 35,000 GitHub stars in just over a year. The team recently released the Colossal-LLaMA-2-13B model, a fine-tuned version of the Llama-2 model, showcasing superior performance despite lower costs.\nThe Colossal-AI cloud platform, aiming to integrate system optimization and low-cost computing resources, has launched AI cloud servers. This platform provides tools like Jupyter Notebook, SSH, port forwarding, and Grafana monitoring, along with Docker images containing the Colossal-AI code repository, simplifying the development of large AI models.\n","create_date":"2024-01-09","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"},{"url":"https://blockchain.news/analysis/exploring-the-boundaries-of-ai-in-creative-domains-can-machines-match-human-ingenuity","web_url":"https://blockchain.news","type":"article","description":"We delves into the evolving capabilities of AI in creative domains, analyzing whether artificial intelligence can achieve a level of creativity comparable to humans.","title":"Exploring the Boundaries of AI in Creative Domains: Can Machines Match Human Ingenuity?","content":"Creativity, a trait often deemed uniquely human, is undergoing a renaissance in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, a research paper titled ’Can AI Be as Creative as Humans?’ delved deeply into the exploration of creativity in both humans and artificial intelligence. Historically, creativity has been the backbone of innovation and societal progress. However, with the advent of AI, the boundaries of creativity are being redefined. The research paper \"Can AI Be as Creative as Humans?\" by a team of experts from prestigious institutions provides a pivotal exploration of this topic.\nThe paper underscores AI’s transformative role in both practical and creative domains. Notably, AI has shown proficiency in solving complex problems, such as drug and protein synthesis, as highlighted by Jumper et al. (2021). But more intriguingly, AI has made strides in artistic pursuits, from composing poetry to crafting narratives, challenging the notion that creativity is an exclusively human domain.\nThis shift raises fundamental questions about the nature of creativity and AI’s role in it. Can AI truly be creative, or is it merely mimicking patterns it has learned? To address this, we must consider AI’s current capabilities and limitations. AI systems, especially advanced generative models, have demonstrated the ability to generate novel ideas and concepts. For instance, AI-generated art has gained recognition, with algorithms creating pieces that have been sold in prestigious galleries.\nHowever, creativity is not just about generating novel ideas but also about understanding and connecting with human emotions and experiences. This aspect of creativity, often intertwined with human experiences and subjectivity, poses a challenge for AI. While AI can replicate patterns and styles, its ability to genuinely understand and evoke human emotions is still a subject of debate.\nLooking at the broader implications, the integration of AI in creative processes could lead to a new era of innovation. For industries like advertising, entertainment, and design, AI’s ability to generate novel ideas rapidly can be a game-changer. It could also democratize creativity, enabling individuals without traditional artistic skills to express themselves creatively through AI tools.\nHowever, this also brings ethical considerations. As AI becomes more prevalent in creative fields, questions about authorship, originality, and the value of human creativity emerge. The balance between human creativity and AI assistance needs careful consideration to ensure that AI augments rather than replaces human ingenuity.\nIn conclusion, while AI has made significant strides in creative domains, matching the depth and breadth of human creativity remains a complex challenge. The future of AI in creativity is not about replacing human ingenuity but about collaborating and enhancing our creative capabilities, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for expanding, not limiting, human creativity.\n","create_date":"2024-01-09","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}]}
