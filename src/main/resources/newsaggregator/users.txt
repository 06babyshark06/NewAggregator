The discovery was published with title \"Study shows that the way the brain learns is different from the way that artificial intelligence systems learn\". The Researchers have identified a new principle of brain learning, named \"prospective configuration,\" offering insights into the human brain’s superior learning mechanism compared to artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\nUnderstanding Learning: Human Brain vs. AI\nTraditional AI learning, predominantly based on backpropagation, adjusts model parameters to minimize errors in output. This process starkly differs from the newly discovered brain learning method. The human brain exhibits an exceptional capacity to rapidly assimilate new information while retaining pre-existing knowledge, a feat AI systems have yet to achieve. These capabilities have motivated researchers to explore the underlying principles of brain learning.\nThe Concept of \"Prospective Configuration\"\nThe principle of \"prospective configuration\" posits that the human brain optimizes neuronal activity into a balanced state before adjusting synaptic connections. This approach minimizes interference between new and existing information, enhancing learning efficiency. Computational models employing this principle have shown to learn more effectively and swiftly than current AI models in various simulations, excelling in tasks faced by animals and humans in natural settings.\nFuture Research and Implications\nThe research team, led by Professor Rafal Bogacz and Dr. Yuhang Song, acknowledges the gap between abstract models of brain learning and detailed anatomical knowledge. Future studies aim to understand how \"prospective configuration\" is implemented in specific brain networks. Additionally, the simulation of this principle in machine learning faces challenges due to current computational constraints, suggesting the need for innovative computing technologies or dedicated brain-inspired hardware for efficient and low-energy implementation.\nConclusion\nThis important discovery of the \"prospective configuration\" learning principle in the human brain not only enriches our understanding of neural processes but also holds significant potential for advancing AI technology. It suggests a new direction for AI research, aiming to develop learning algorithms that mimic the efficiency and adaptability of the human brain.\n","create_date":"2024-01-04T15:20:19.6570000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}]}

The company’s performance was driven by increased Bitcoin production, hosting revenue, and effective cost management. However, it also faces risks associated with Bitcoin price volatility and substantial debt. Let’s delve into the details of Core Scientific’s Q1 2023 financial report.\nRobust Revenue Growth\nCore Scientific reported a total revenue of $179.3 million in Q1 2023, representing a significant 49% increase compared to the previous year. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including increased Bitcoin production and hosting revenue. The company’s Bitcoin mining revenue reached $150 million, while hosting revenue contributed $29.3 million. The higher Bitcoin prices and the company’s mining capacity played a crucial role in driving revenue growth.\nImproved Profitability\nCore Scientific achieved a net income of $210.7 million in Q1 2023, a substantial improvement from the net loss of $388,000 in the previous year. This impressive profitability can be attributed to gains from obligations and a decrease in Chapter 11 financing expenses. The company’s effective cost management and operational efficiency also played a significant role in driving profitability.\nKey Financial Metrics\nSeveral key financial metrics highlight Core Scientific’s strong performance in Q1 2023:\nGross Margin: The company achieved an overall gross margin of 43%, with Digital Asset Mining contributing 46% and Hosting contributing 32%.\nOperating Margin: Core Scientific achieved an operating margin of 31%.\nAdjusted EBITDA: The company reported an adjusted EBITDA of $88 million, representing a remarkable 118% increase year-over-year.\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Core Scientific’s cash and cash equivalents increased to $98 million, up from $50 million at the end of 2023.\nDebt Reduction: The company successfully reduced its debt to $608 million from nearly $1 billion at the end of 2023.\nBitcoin Production and Power Cost:\nCore Scientific’s Bitcoin production in Q1 2023 reached 2,825 bitcoins, the highest among public companies. The company’s power cost per kilowatt-hour was $0.043, and it is expected to be between $0.045 and $0.047 in 2024 . These figures demonstrate Core Scientific’s efficiency in Bitcoin mining operations.\nExpansion and Infrastructure\nCore Scientific has expanded its infrastructure footprint, currently operating 745 megawatts with contracts for up to 1.2 gigawatts. This expansion positions the company as a leader in Bitcoin mining infrastructure. Additionally, Core Scientific has entered into a high-performance compute hosting contract, leveraging its existing infrastructure for new revenue streams. This strategic focus on both Bitcoin mining and high-performance compute hosting provides stable, multiyear, high-visibility cash flows, which can help buffer against Bitcoin price volatility.\nChallenges and Risks\nWhile Core Scientific has achieved impressive financial results, it faces inherent risks associated with the volatility of Bitcoin prices, which can impact profitability. The company’s significant reliance on the cryptocurrency market exposes it to regulatory and market risks that could affect operational stability. Furthermore, Core Scientific has a substantial amount of debt, although it has been reduced to $608 million from the previous year. The company’s growth and expansion plans require substantial ongoing investment in infrastructure and technology . The transition into high-performance compute hosting also requires significant time and capital investment, with full conversion of infrastructure projected to take three to four years.\n","create_date":"2024-05-09T14:23:30.5580000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"},{"url":"https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-and-shiba-inu-investors-pivot-to-dtx-banking-on-its-potential-for-massive-returns/","web_url":"https://bitcoinist.com/","type":"article","description":"Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing price declines, leading many investors to turn to DTX Exchange (DTX) for potential opportunities.

DTX, a new presale crypto, has an impressive ongoing presale, cutting-edge trading features, and the potential for substantial gains even in a volatile market. It’s, therefore, no wonder that such a strong market leader would naturally influence ETH and SHIB investors. Here’s more!\n\u003e\u003e\u003e BUY DTX TOKENS HERE \u003c\u003c\u003c\nMay 2024 saw a strong start for the global cryptocurrency market as investors heaped on cash inflows throughout the first week. But the market has not rallied as much since the first week of May ended, with bears erasing much of the earlier gains.\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, felt the bearish pressure and saw a price decline, shedding some of its earlier highs. From the beginning of Q2 to the second week of May 2024, Ethereum’s (ETH) price declined by 21% from $3,648 to a low of $2,881.\nThe lacklustre performance of Ethereum (ETH) may be due to unfavorable perceptions and several setbacks regarding Ethereum ETF approval chances in the United States. Furthermore, the ongoing decrease in ETH open interest compared to spot market activity may hinder the possibility of Ethereum’s price surpassing $3,100 by the end of May 2024.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the best-performing meme coins in 2024. In the first week of March, Shiba Inu’s price jumped by 338.49% to a high of $0.00004534 from its starting of the year amount of $0.00001034.\nConsequently, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap grew from $6 billion to $21 billion in the same period. However, things have not been so rosy for Shiba Inu in Q2 of 2024 as SHIB has traded below the $0.00003 price level, erasing most of its earlier gains.\nStill, things look up for SHIB. Experts predict that the Shiba Inu coin burn in the second week of May could help push the price to the $0.00003 level by the end of May 2024. Conversely, a market downturn and a shift to a bearish outlook could see Shiba Inu (SHIB) tumble to $0.000022 in the same period.\nInvestors are increasingly drawn to the new presale token DTX Exchange (DTX) as they seek more stable investment opportunities amidst the uncertain future of Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). One of the reasons why DTX Exchange (DTX) stands out is its strong emphasis on security and wide range of features.\nIn addition, DTX Exchange (DTX) offers an inclusive platform that enables anyone to quickly start trading with its high leverage of 1000x.
